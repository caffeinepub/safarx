Inspect the backend actor call used to retrieve all inquiries (e.g. `getAllInquiries` or equivalent), ensure the correct method name is being called on the actor, that the actor hook is resolving properly before the query fires (use `enabled: !!actor` guard in React Query), and that the returned data shape is correctly mapped to the card/table display. If the backend method name or return type has drifted, align the frontend call to match the actual exported function in `backend/main.mo`.",
