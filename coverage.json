Ensure the modal/panel and its trigger button have a z-index higher than the header (the header uses a fixed position with its own stacking context), and that any modal overlay, dialog container, or inline auth panel is rendered with sufficient z-index (e.g., z-50 or higher) and correct top/padding offset so the button is fully visible and clickable without being covered by the navigation bar.",
