  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-35 by lowering the header's z-index from z-50 to z-40 in Header.tsx, which allows modal dialogs using z-50 to render above the header. The frontend-file-summaries.txt confirms this change explicitly. This addresses the core requirement of ensuring the CommunityAuthModal and its trigger button are not obscured by the fixed header.",
