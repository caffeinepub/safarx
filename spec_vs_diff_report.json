  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements. REQ-31 is addressed by fixing useGetAllInquiries with enabled guard and correct method name in useQueries.ts and updating Admin.tsx. REQ-32 is addressed by adding getCommunityStats and getAllCommunityUsers to backend/main.mo (though the full backend diff is truncated, the file summary and frontend hooks confirm their existence). REQ-33 adds useCommunityStats and useCommunityUserList hooks with enabled guards. REQ-34 updates Admin.tsx with the Community Stats section, stat cards, user table, loading skeletons, error states, and warm-earthy theme styling. All requirements appear to be implemented with no significant missing items or hallucinated features detected.",
